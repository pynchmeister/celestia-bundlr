## Notes

* Intuition is that CIDs can be processed on Celestia (where exactly, is the question--gossipsub(?)), which route to bundlr, or equivalent service.

* Possibly can add the lesson metadata fields (see here: https://github.com/DED-EDU/DED/blob/main/src/DEDListing.sol) to the Client struct here: https://github.com/DED-EDU/rollmint/blob/main/p2p/client.go (?)
